    <h2> (The Most Holy Tablet)<sup>1</sup> </h2>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        This is the Most Holy Tablet sent down from the holy kingdom unto the one who hath set his face towards the Object of the adoration of the world, He
        Who hath come from the heaven of eternity, invested with transcendent glory
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    In the name of the Lord, the Lord of great glory.
</p>
<p>
    This is an Epistle from Our presence unto him whom the veils of names have failed to keep back from God, the Creator of earth and heaven, that his eyes may
    be cheered in the days of his Lord, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
</p>
<p>
    Say, O followers of the Son!<sup>2</sup> Have ye shut out yourselves from Me by reason of My Name? Wherefore ponder ye not in your hearts? Day and night ye
    have been calling upon your Lord, the Omnipotent, but when He came from the heaven of eternity in His great glory, ye turned aside from Him and remained
    sunk in heedlessness.
</p>
<p>
    Consider those who rejected the Spirit<sup>3</sup> when He came unto them with manifest dominion. How numerous the Pharisees who had secluded themselves in
    synagogues in His name, lamenting over their separation from Him, and yet when the portals of reunion were flung open and the divine Luminary shone
    resplendent from the Dayspring of Beauty, they disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Mighty. They failed to attain His presence, notwithstanding that His
    advent had been promised them in the Book of Isaiah as well as in the Books of the Prophets and the Messengers. No one from among them turned his face
    towards the Dayspring of divine bounty except such as were destitute of any power amongst men. And yet, today, every man endowed with power and invested
    with sovereignty prideth himself on His Name. Moreover, call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to death. He was the most learned of his age in his
    own country, whilst he who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take good heed and be of them that observe the warning.
</p>
<p>
    Consider likewise, how numerous at this time are the monks who have secluded themselves in their churches, calling upon the Spirit, but when He appeared
    through the power of Truth, they failed to draw nigh unto Him and are numbered with those that have gone far astray. Happy are they that have abandoned
    them and set their faces towards Him Who is the Desire of all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth.
</p>
<p>
    They read the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious Lord, notwithstanding that He hath come through the potency of His exalted, His mighty
    and gracious dominion. We, verily, have come for your sakes, and have borne the misfortunes of the world for your salvation. Flee ye the One Who hath
    sacrificed His life that ye may be quickened? Fear God, O followers of the Spirit, and walk not in the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray.
    Do ye imagine that He seeketh His own interests, when He hath, at all times, been threatened by the swords of the enemies; or that He seeketh the vanities
    of the world, after He hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities? Be fair in your judgment and follow not the footsteps of the unjust.
</p>
<p>
    Open the doors of your hearts. He Who is the Spirit verily standeth before them. Wherefore keep ye afar from Him Who hath purposed to draw you nigh unto a
    Resplendent Spot? Say: We, in truth, have opened unto you the gates of the Kingdom. Will ye bar the doors of your houses in My face? This indeed is naught
    but a grievous error. He, verily, hath again come down from heaven, even as He came down from it the first time. Beware lest ye dispute that which He
    proclaimeth, even as the people before you disputed His utterances. Thus instructeth you the True One, could ye but perceive it.
</p>
<p>
    The river Jordan is joined to the Most Great Ocean, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: &#8220;Here am I, here am I O Lord, my God!&#8221;, whilst
    Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: &#8220;He Who is the Desired One is come in His transcendent majesty.&#8221; Say, Lo!
    The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son concealed, when to those around Him He
    said: &#8220;Ye cannot bear it now.&#8221; And when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Hour had struck, the Word shone forth above the horizon of the
    Will of God. Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it not behind your backs. Take ye fast hold of it. Better is this for you than all that ye
    possess. Verily He is nigh unto them that do good. The Hour which We had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples of the earth and of the favored angels
    hath come to pass. Say, verily, He hath testified of Me, and I do testify of Him. Indeed, He hath purposed no one other than Me. Unto this beareth witness
    every fair-minded and understanding soul.
</p>
<p>
    Though beset with countless afflictions, We summon the people unto God, the Lord of names. Say, strive ye to attain that which ye have been promised in the
    Books of God, and walk not in the way of the ignorant. My body hath endured imprisonment that ye may be released from the bondage of self. Set your faces
    then towards His countenance and follow not the footsteps of every hostile oppressor. Verily, He hath consented to be sorely abased that ye may attain unto
    glory, and yet, ye are disporting yourselves in the vale of heedlessness. He, in truth, liveth in the most desolate of abodes for your sakes, whilst ye
    dwell in your palaces.
</p>
<p>
    Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the wilderness of the Bay&#225;n, bearing unto you the glad-tidings of the coming of
    your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is come in the sheltering shadow of Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and evidence, and those who truly believe
    in Him regard His presence as the embodiment of the Kingdom of God. Blessed is the man who turneth towards Him, and woe betide such as deny or doubt Him.
</p>
<p>
    Announce thou unto the priests: Lo! He Who is the Ruler is come. Step out from behind the veil in the name of thy Lord, He Who layeth low the necks of all
    men. Proclaim then unto all mankind the glad-tidings of this mighty, this glorious Revelation. Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you
    unto all truth. He speaketh not as prompted by His own self, but as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
</p>
<p>
    Say, this is the One Who hath glorified the Son and hath exalted His Cause. Cast away, O peoples of the earth, that which ye have and take fast hold of
    that which ye are bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is the Bearer of the Trust of God. Purge ye your ears and set your hearts towards Him that ye may
    hearken to the most wondrous Call which hath been raised from Sinai, the habitation of your Lord, the Most Glorious. It will, in truth, draw you nigh unto
    the Spot wherein ye will perceive the splendor of the light of His countenance which shineth above this luminous Horizon.
</p>
<p>
    O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your churches. It behooveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great Name
    among the nations. Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: &#8220;The Lord is come in His great glory!&#8221;? Well is it
    with the man who hasteneth unto Him. Verily, he is numbered among them whose names will be eternally recorded and who will be mentioned by the Concourse on
    High. Thus hath it been decreed by the Spirit in this wondrous Tablet. He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth that
    which is beyond the power of all that are on earth. Follow ye the Way of the Lord and walk not in the footsteps of them that are sunk in heedlessness. Well
    is it with the slumberer who is stirred by the Breeze of God and ariseth from amongst the dead, directing his steps towards the Way of the Lord. Verily,
    such a man is regarded, in the sight of God, the True One, as a jewel amongst men and is reckoned with the blissful.
</p>
<p>
    Say: In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West have appeared the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people, and be
    not of those who have turned a deaf ear to the admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised. Let the Breeze of God awaken you. Verily, it hath
    wafted over the world. Well is it with him that hath discovered the fragrance thereof and been accounted among the well-assured.
</p>
<p>
    O concourse of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My knowledge. My mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice, however,
    declareth: &#8220;This is that which the Son hath decreed.&#8221; And whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking, trustworthy
    mouth, can never be altered. The bells, verily, peal out My Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit rejoiceth with evident gladness. The body of the Loved
    One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager for the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful. The ascendancy of the oppressor can in no wise deter Him
    from His purpose. We have summoned all created things to attain the presence of thy Lord, the King of all names. Blessed is the man that hath set his face
    towards God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning.
</p>
<p>
    O concourse of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I will make you heirs of My Kingdom; and if ye transgress against Me, I will, in My long-suffering, endure
    it patiently, and I, verily, am the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.
</p>
<p>
    O land of Syria! What hath become of thy righteousness? Thou art, in truth, ennobled by the footsteps of thy Lord. Hast thou perceived the fragrance of
    heavenly reunion, or art thou to be accounted of the heedless?
</p>
<p>
    Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying: &#8220;O most generous Lord! Where is Thy great glory established? The sweet savors of
    Thy presence have quickened me, after I had melted in my separation from Thee. Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the veils, and come with power in
    evident glory.&#8221; We called unto her from behind the Tabernacle of Majesty and Grandeur: &#8220;O Bethlehem! This Light hath risen in the orient, and
    traveled towards the occident, until it reached thee in the evening of its life. Tell Me then: Do the sons recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do
    they deny Him, even as the people aforetime denied Him (Jesus)?&#8221; Whereupon she cried out saying: &#8220;Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the
    Best-Informed.&#8221; Verily, We behold all created things moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us and bear witness, while the majority bear witness,
    yet know Us not.
</p>
<p>
    Mount Sinai is astir with the joy of beholding Our countenance. She hath lifted her enthralling voice in glorification of her Lord, saying: &#8220;O Lord!
    I sense the fragrance of Thy garment. Methinks Thou art near, invested with the signs of God. Thou hast ennobled these regions with Thy footsteps. Great is
    the blessedness of Thy people, could they but know Thee and inhale Thy sweet savors; and woe betide them that are fast asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    Happy art thou who hast turned thy face towards My countenance, inasmuch as thou hast rent the veils asunder, hast shattered the idols and recognized thine
    eternal Lord. The people of the Qur&#8217;&#225;n have risen up against Us without any clear proof or evidence, tormenting Us at every moment with a fresh
    torment. They idly imagine that tribulations can frustrate Our Purpose. Vain indeed is that which they have imagined. Verily, thy Lord is the One Who
    ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.
</p>
<p>
    I never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying: &#8220;O would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee.&#8221; We
    revealed this passage in the Epistle to the Sh&#225;h that it might serve as a warning to the followers of religions. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing,
    the All-Wise.
</p>
<p>
    Let not the things they have perpetrated grieve thee. Truly they are even as dead, and not living. Leave them unto the dead, then turn thy face towards Him
    Who is the Life-Giver of the world. Beware lest the sayings of the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and teach the people with
    consummate wisdom. Thus enjoineth thee the Ruler of earth and heaven. He is in truth the Almighty, the Most Generous. Erelong will God exalt thy
    remembrance and will inscribe with the Pen of Glory that which thou didst utter for the sake of His love. He is in truth the Protector of the doers of
    good.
</p>
<p>
    Give My remembrance to the one named Mur&#225;d and say: &#8220;Blessed art thou, O Mur&#225;d, inasmuch as thou didst cast away the promptings of thine
    own desire and hast followed Him Who is the Desire of all mankind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    Say: Blessed the slumberer who is awakened by My Breeze. Blessed the lifeless one who is quickened through My reviving breaths. Blessed the eye that is
    solaced by gazing at My beauty. Blessed the wayfarer who directeth his steps towards the Tabernacle of My glory and majesty. Blessed the distressed one who
    seeketh refuge beneath the shadow of My canopy. Blessed the sore athirst who hasteneth to the soft-flowing waters of My loving-kindness. Blessed the
    insatiate soul who casteth away his selfish desires for love of Me and taketh his place at the banquet table which I have sent down from the heaven of
    divine bounty for My chosen ones. Blessed the abased one who layeth fast hold on the cord of My glory; and the needy one who entereth beneath the shadow of
    the Tabernacle of My wealth. Blessed the ignorant one who seeketh the fountain of My knowledge; and the heedless one who cleaveth to the cord of My
    remembrance. Blessed the soul that hath been raised to life through My quickening breath and hath gained admittance into My heavenly Kingdom. Blessed the
    man whom the sweet savors of reunion with Me have stirred and caused to draw nigh unto the Dayspring of My Revelation. Blessed the ear that hath heard and
    the tongue that hath borne witness and the eye that hath seen and recognized the Lord Himself, in His great glory and majesty, invested with grandeur and
    dominion. Blessed are they that have attained His presence. Blessed the man who hath sought enlightenment from the Daystar of My Word. Blessed he who hath
    attired his head with the diadem of My love. Blessed is he who hath heard of My grief and hath arisen to aid Me among My people. Blessed is he who hath
    laid down his life in My path and hath borne manifold hardships for the sake of My name. Blessed the man who, assured of My Word, hath arisen from among
    the dead to celebrate My praise. Blessed is he that hath been enraptured by My wondrous melodies and hath rent the veils asunder through the potency of My
    might. Blessed is he who hath remained faithful to My Covenant, and whom the things of the world have not kept back from attaining My Court of holiness.
    Blessed is the man who hath detached himself from all else but Me, hath soared in the atmosphere of My love, hath gained admittance into My Kingdom, gazed
    upon My realms of glory, quaffed the living waters of My bounty, hath drunk his fill from the heavenly river of My loving providence, acquainted himself
    with My Cause, apprehended that which I concealed within the treasury of My Words, and hath shone forth from the horizon of divine knowledge engaged in My
    praise and glorification. Verily, he is of Me. Upon him rest My mercy, My loving-kindness, My bounty and My glory.
