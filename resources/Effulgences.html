    <h1>Tajall&#237;y&#225;t</h1>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>(Effulgences)</h2>
</p>
<p>
    <em>This is the Epistle of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting</em>
</p>
<p>
    He is the One Who heareth from His Realm of Glory.
</p>
<p>
    God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who hath appeared is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, the Most Great Book for all
    peoples, and the Heaven of bounty for the whole world. He is the Most Mighty Sign amongst men and the Dayspring of the most august attributes in the realm
    of creation. Through Him hath appeared that which had been hidden from time immemorial and been veiled from the eyes of men. He is the One Whose
    Manifestation was announced by the heavenly Scriptures, in former times and more recently. Whoso acknowledgeth belief in Him and in His signs and
    testimonies hath in truth acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven and the revelation of the Kingdom of
    Names. Through Him the ocean of knowledge hath surged amidst mankind and the river of divine wisdom hath gushed out at the behest of God, the Lord of Days.
</p>
<p>
    Well is it with the man of discernment who hath recognized and perceived the Truth, and the one possessed of a hearing ear who hath hearkened unto His
    sweet Voice, and the hand that hath received His Book with such resolve as is born of God, the Lord of this world and of the next, and the earnest wayfarer
    who hath hastened unto His glorious Horizon, and the one endued with strength whom neither the overpowering might of the rulers, nor the tumult raised by
    the leaders of religion hath been able to shake. And woe betide him who hath rejected the grace of God and His bounty, and hath denied His tender mercy and
    authority; such a man is indeed reckoned with those who have throughout eternity repudiated the testimony of God and His proof.
</p>
<p>
    Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the things current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is ordained by God, the Lord
    of Names and the Fashioner of all created things, He Who is come from the heaven of eternity through the power of the Most Great Name, invested with so
    invincible an authority that all the powers of the earth are unable to withstand Him. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book, calling from the Most
    Sublime Station.
</p>
<p>
    O &#8216;Al&#237;-Akbar!<sup>1</sup> We have repeatedly heard thy voice and have responded to thee with that which the praise of all mankind can never
    rival; from which the sincere ones inhale the sweet savors of the sayings of the All-Merciful, and His true lovers perceive the fragrance of heavenly
    reunion, and the sore athirst discover the murmuring of the water that is life indeed. Blessed the man who hath attained thereto and hath recognized that
    which is at this moment being diffused from the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.
</p>
<p>
    We testify that thou hast set thy face towards God and traveled far until thou didst attain His presence and gavest ear unto the Voice of this Wronged One,
    Who hath been cast into prison through the misdeeds of those who have disbelieved in the signs and testimonies of God and have denied this heavenly grace
    through which the whole world hath been made to shine. Blessed thy face, for it hath turned unto Him, and thine ear, for it hath heard His Voice, and thy
    tongue, for it hath celebrated the praise of God, the Lord of lords. We pray God to graciously aid thee to become a standard for the promotion of His Cause
    and to enable thee to draw nigh unto Him at all times and under all conditions.
</p>
<p>
    The chosen ones of God and His loved ones in that land are remembered by Us, and We give them the joyful tidings of that which hath been sent down in their
    honor from the Kingdom of the utterance of their Lord, the sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning. Make mention of Me to them and illumine them with the
    resplendent glory of Mine utterance. Verily thy Lord is the Gracious, the Bountiful.
</p>
<p>
    O thou who dost magnify My praise! Give ear unto that which the people of tyranny ascribe unto Me in My days. Some of them say: &#8220;He hath laid claim
    to divinity&#8221;; others say: &#8220;He hath devised a lie against God&#8221;; still others say: &#8220;He is come to foment sedition.&#8221; Base and
    wretched are they. Lo! They are, in truth, enslaved to idle imaginings.
</p>
<p>
    We shall now cease using the eloquent language.<sup>2</sup> Truly thy Lord is the Potent, the Unconstrained. We would fain speak in the Persian tongue that
    perchance the people of Persia, one and all, may become aware of the utterances of the merciful Lord, and come forth to discover the Truth.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>The first Tajall&#237;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    which hath dawned from the Daystar of Truth is the knowledge of God&#8212;exalted be His glory. And the knowledge of the King of everlasting days can in no
    wise be attained save by recognizing Him Who is the Bearer of the Most Great Name. He is, in truth, the Speaker on Sinai Who is now seated upon the throne
    of Revelation. He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Symbol. All the former and latter Books of God are adorned with His praise and extol His glory.
    Through Him the standard of knowledge hath been planted in the world and the ensign of the oneness of God hath been unfurled amidst all peoples. Attainment
    unto the Divine Presence can be realized solely by attaining His presence. Through His potency everything that hath, from time immemorial, been veiled and
    hidden, is now revealed. He is made manifest through the power of Truth and hath uttered a Word whereby all that are in the heavens and on the earth have
    been dumbfounded, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to exempt. True belief in God and recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of
    that which He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory.
</p>
<p>
    They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and
    prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples&#8212;a light
    upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth, and a fire unto such as turn away and deny.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>The second Tajall&#237;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    is to remain steadfast in the Cause of God&#8212;exalted be His glory&#8212;and to be unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be attained except
    through full recognition of Him; and full recognition cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words: &#8220;He doeth whatsoever He willeth.&#8221;
    Whoso tenaciously cleaveth unto this sublime word and drinketh deep from the living waters of utterance which are inherent therein, will be imbued with
    such a constancy that all the books of the world will be powerless to deter him from the Mother Book. O how glorious is this sublime station, this exalted
    rank, this ultimate purpose!
</p>
<p>
    O &#8216;Al&#237;-Akbar! Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They all give utterance to the words: &#8220;Verily He is to be praised in
    His deeds and is to be obeyed in His behest.&#8221; Nevertheless if We reveal aught which, even to the extent of a needle&#8217;s eye, runneth counter to
    their selfish ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it. Say, none can ever fathom the manifold exigencies of God&#8217;s consummate wisdom. In
    truth, were He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to question His authority. This is that whereunto the Point of the Bay&#225;n
    hath testified in all that was sent down unto Him with truth at the behest of God, He Who hath caused the Dawn to break.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>The third Tajall&#237;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    is concerning arts, crafts and sciences. Knowledge is as wings to man&#8217;s life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon
    everyone. The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end
    with words. Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book on the day of His
    return. Happy are those possessed of a hearing ear. In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of
    exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this Most Great Prison.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>The fourth Tajall&#237;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    is concerning Divinity, Godhead and the like. Were a man of insight to direct his gaze towards the blessed, the manifest Lote-Tree and its fruits, he would
    be so enriched thereby as to be independent of aught else and to acknowledge his belief in that which the Speaker on Sinai hath uttered from the throne of
    Revelation.
</p>
<p>
    O &#8216;Al&#237;-Akbar! Acquaint the people with the holy verses of thy Lord and make known unto them His straight Path, His mighty Announcement.
</p>
<p>
    Say: O people, if ye judge fairly and equitably, ye will testify to the truth of whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen. If ye be of the
    people of the Bay&#225;n, the Persian Bay&#225;n will guide you aright and will prove a sufficient testimony unto you; and if ye be of the people of the
    Qur&#8217;&#225;n, ponder ye upon the Revelation on Sinai and the Voice from the Bush which came unto the Son of &#8216;Imr&#225;n [Moses].
</p>
<p>
    Gracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the One true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been developed and
    matured and would have reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly demonstrated that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained undeveloped and
    hath, indeed, degenerated.
</p>
<p>
    O &#8216;Al&#237;! That which they accepted from the Bush they now refuse to accept from Him Who is the Tree of the world of existence. Say, O people of
    the Bay&#225;n, speak not according to the dictates of passion and selfish desire. Most of the peoples of the earth attest the truth of the blessed Word
    which hath come forth from the Bush.
</p>
<p>
    By the righteousness of God! But for the anthem of praise voiced by Him Who heralded the divine Revelation, this Wronged One would never have breathed a
    word which might have struck terror into the hearts of the ignorant and caused them to perish. Dwelling on the glorification of Him Whom God shall make
    manifest&#8212;exalted be His Manifestation&#8212;the B&#225;b in the beginning of the Bay&#225;n saith: &#8220;He is the One Who shall proclaim under all
    conditions, &#8220;Verily, verily, I am God, no God is there but Me, the Lord of all created things. In truth all others except Me are My creatures. O, My
    creatures! Me alone do ye worship.&#8217;&#8221; Likewise in another instance He, magnifying the Name of Him Who shall be made manifest, saith: &#8220;I
    would be the first to adore Him.&#8221; Now it behooveth one to reflect upon the significance of the &#8220;Adorer&#8221; and the &#8220;Adored One,&#8221;
    that perchance the people of the earth may partake of a dewdrop from the ocean of divine knowledge and may be enabled to perceive the greatness of this
    Revelation. Verily, He hath appeared and hath unloosed His tongue to proclaim the Truth. Well is it with him who doth acknowledge and recognize the truth,
    and woe betide the froward and the wayward.
</p>
<p>
    O kindreds of the earth! Incline your ears unto the Voice from the divine Lote-Tree which overshadoweth the world and be not of the people of tyranny on
    earth&#8212;men who have repudiated the Manifestation of God and His invincible authority and have renounced His favors&#8212;they in truth are reckoned
    with the contemptible in the Book of God, the Lord of all mankind.
</p>
<p>
    The Glory which hath dawned above the horizon of My tender mercy rest upon thee and upon whosoever is with thee and giveth ear to thy words concerning the
    Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.
